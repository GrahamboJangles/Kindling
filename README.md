2. Go to https://www.youtube.com/account_privacy, uncheck "Keep all my subscriptions private". (not required the person running the script, but for your friends, it is.)
3. Go to https://www.youtube.com/account_advanced to get your Channel ID, and tell your friends to do steps 1 & 2, and have them send you their Channel IDs to add to the [`youtube_channel_ids.txt`](/youtube_channel_ids.txt).
4. The person running the script should have their YouTube Channel ID as the first line in [`youtube_channel_ids.txt`](/youtube_channel_ids.txt).
5. Add your friends or potential friends' IDs to the next lines.
6. Run v5.py

# To Do:
* Make it a web app
* Store users subscriptions to a database to find new friends that have previously used the website
* Add messaging functionality OR allow people to add their social medias so they can now make friends :)
