Uses data from social medias to connect and make friends.

# Instructions
1. Get an API key by following this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th5_9woFJmk. Once you have it put it in `api_key.txt`.
2. Go to https://www.youtube.com/account_privacy, uncheck "Keep all my subscriptions private". (not required the person running the script, but for your friends, it is.)
3. Go to https://www.youtube.com/account_advanced to get your Channel ID, and tell your friends to do steps 1 & 2, and have them send you their Channel IDs to add to the `youtube_channel_ids.txt`.
4. The person running the script should have their YouTube Channel ID as the first line in `youtube_channel_ids.txt`
5. Add your friends or potential friends' IDs to the next lines.
6. Run v5.py

# To Do:
* Make it a web app
* Store users subscriptions to a database to find new friends that have previously used the website
* Add messaging functionality OR allow people to add their social medias so they can now make friends :)
